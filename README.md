 Hello! In this Application, front end could not be linked to the database as there
was a error and access denied whenever we tried to make a call for the database. We tried many methods including
using a proxy but that didn't work either.<br><br>

 However, it can be tested using Postman to perform all CRUD operations on the actual database.
 The Front end is made up using Angular,HTML,CSS,Bootstrap and contains mock up data for the purpose of demonstration.<br><br>
